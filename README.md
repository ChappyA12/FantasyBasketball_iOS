# FantasyBasketball_iOS
## Intro
This app accesses basketball player data from a variety of online sources including [espn.com](espn.com), [rotoworld.com](rotoworld.com), [nba.com](nba.com), and more for the purpose of tracking and evaluating NBA player performance.

In addition, this app tracks advanced metrics such as fantasy team win percentage based on players' historical fantasy performances and p-score probability equations.

## Installation
#### Cocoapods
Make sure you have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) installed on your computer and that the pod is initialized in the FanstasyBasketball folder. When opening the project, make sure you open the .xcworkspace file and NOT the .xcodeproj file. Upon opening the project, 5 defualt fantasy teams (belonging to 2 leagues) and 1 watch list will be provided as a proof-of-concept. If you would like to track your own fantasy team, note that this app can only be used if your league is an ESPN fantasy basketball league with default "custom" scoring settings. This app uses the following pods:
* [Hpple](https://github.com/topfunky/hpple) - website parsing
* [BEMLineGraph](https://github.com/Boris-Em/BEMSimpleLineGraph) - bar and line graphs
* [ZFDragableModalTransition](https://github.com/zoonooz/ZFDragableModalTransition) - popup screen views
* [RESideMenu](https://github.com/romaonthego/RESideMenu) - parallax side menu
* [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html) on-device data storage
